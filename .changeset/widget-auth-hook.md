Embeddable-widget auth (SMOODEV-1878): a pluggable `WidgetAuthProvider` hook in the Rust server that enforces a per-agent **origin allowlist** + public-key **`authContext`** (HMAC-SHA256, replay-protected) for `<smooth-agent-chat>` connections. The `Origin` header is captured at the WebSocket handshake and validated at `create_conversation_session`; hosts plug in a concrete provider (backed by their agent store) while the bundled `PermissiveWidgetAuth` leaves a standalone OSS server unaffected. `WIDGET_AUTH_STRICT=1` fails closed on unknown agents.

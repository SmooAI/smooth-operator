Conversation-workflow adherence (th-d57a1d): the rendered `<ConversationWorkflow>` step section now instructs the agent to ask the current step's question directly and never re-ask for permission / re-confirm readiness / repeat an answered question (gpt-oss-class models over-indexed on the old "you don't have to force the step to close" line and looped on re-confirmation). The workflow judge now counts brief/terse answers that address the step ("a four", "sure") as satisfying it instead of holding out for elaboration. Same wording change applied across all five language servers (TS, Rust, Python, Go, .NET).
